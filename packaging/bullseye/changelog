autotier (1.1.5-1bullseye) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * No longer reports 'cannot open directory' if missing from one of the tiers.
  * On file name conflict while moving files between tiers, both files are
    renamed with '.autotier_conflict' and '.autotier_conflict_orig' appended.
  * Added `autotier-init-dirs` script to clone directories only across each
    tier for if data is already present before setting up autotier.
  * Ensures that every call to open() contains a file mode, fixing a fatal
    bug in Ubuntu.

autotier (1.1.4-1bullseye) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Tiering of files is automatically triggered if tier is over quota after
    writing to a file. To disable, added config option `Strict Period = true`.
  * Added disabling of tier period by setting to a negative number so a cron
    job for `autotier oneshot` can be used to trigger tiering.
  * `autotier config` now dumps configuration values from memory of mounted
    filesystem rather than just printing contents of file.
  * Implemented parallel moving of files while tiering with one thread per
    tier for maximum concurrency.
  * Fix bug where readdir was still showing backend autotier files.
  * Tiering of files is automatically triggered if tier is out of space, and
    write() call blocks until tiering is done and the write is tried again.
  * Added Copy Buffer Size configration parameter to specify block size
    while moving files between tiers.
