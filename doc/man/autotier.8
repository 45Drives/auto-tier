.SH NAME
autotier \- a passthrough FUSE filesystem that intelligently moves files
between storage tiers based on frequency of use, file age, and tier fullness.

.B autotier

.I mountpoint

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B autotier
acts as a passthrough fuse filesystem to combine multiple underlying filesystems, or
.IR tier s,
into one pool of storage. Each
.I tier
should be a separate filesystem. Any number of
.IR tier s
can be defined in the configuration file for autotier. Files are moved between each
.I tier
based on their
.IR popularity ,
and
.B autotier
will attempt to keep the percent usage of each 
.I tier
below the 
.IR tier 's
.IR watermark .

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c, --config <path/to/config/file>"
Override configuration file path (default /etc/autotier.conf).
.IP "-h, --help"
Display usage message and cancel current command.
.IP "-o, --fuse-options <comma,separated,list>"
Options for fuse filsystem. See
.B fuse(8)
for details.
.IP "--quiet"
Mute log output, other than warnings and errors. Overrides
.I Log Level
in the configuration file to 0.
.IP "--verbose"
Print debug level output. Overrides
.I Log Level
in the configuration file to 2.

.SH AD HOC COMMANDS
.IP config
Print current configuration file.
.IP help
Display usage message and cancel current command.
.IP list-pins
Show all pinned files along with the tier they are pinned to.
.IP list-popularity
Print all files in filesystem along with their popularity scores (accesses per hour).
.IP oneshot
Execute tiering of files immediately.
.IP "pin <tier name> <path/to/file path/to/file ...>"
Move files into the given tier and keep them there regardless of their popularity scores.
.IP status
Print info about each tier, including the tier name, path, usage, and watermark.
.IP "unpin <path/to/file path/to/file ...>"
Remove the "pinned" flag from each file to allow the tiering process to move it.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The default location of the configuration file is
.BR /etc/autotier.conf .
.SS FORMAT
.B autotier
configuration contains sections and parameters. Sections are groupings of parameters that
begin with a header name in square brackets. There is one special section header name,
.IR global ,
which contains global autotier configuration parameters. Sections with headers containing anything
other than
.I global
are
.IR tiers .
The parameters of each section take the form of
.I Key
=
.IR value .

.SS GLOBAL PARAMETERS
The following parameters are to be put under the
.B [Global]
header.
.IP "Log Level = 0|1|2"
The level at which to print log messages. If the value is
.BR 0 ,
all informational messages are muted and only warnings and errors are printed. If the value is
.BR 1 ,
normal informational log messages are printed. If the value is
.BR 2 ,
debug messages will also be printed. This value is overridden by the
.I --verbose
and
.I --quiet
flags.
.IP "Tier Period = n"
Number of seconds between each tiering of files. Must be an integer in the range [0, INT64_MAX].

.SS TIER DEFINITIONS
Pick a friendly name for the tier and use that as the header name.
There needs to be at least two tiers, however there is no upper limit. That said, keep the number of tiers reasonable.
The following parameters are to be put in each tier section.
.IP "Path = /full/path/to/tier"
The path to the tier mountpoint/directory. Keep in mind that each tier should be in a
separate filesystem for intended functionality.
.IP "Watermark = n"
The tier's quota. Must be an integer in the range [0, 100]. While moving files around, 
.B autotier
attemptes to keep the percent usage of each tier below this level.

.SS EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION

.br
Log Level = 1          # 0 = none, 1 = normal, 2 = debug
.br
Tier Period = 10       # number of seconds between file move batches
